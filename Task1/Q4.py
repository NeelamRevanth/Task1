#There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().  
#The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output: 
#Create any your won example that have to use print() method and println().

# Example showing default newline and no-newline behavior

# Works like println() (default behavior: adds newline)
print("Hello")  
print("World")  

# Works like print() in Java (no newline)
print("Hello", end="")  
print("World")
